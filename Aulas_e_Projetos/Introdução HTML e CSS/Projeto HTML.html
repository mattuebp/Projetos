                    With regard to the precarious and critical voltage limits for the consumption voltages provided by energy authorities, it can be said that they are extremely important definitions for the supply of the community in general. This is due to the fact that such limits guarantee the delivery of energy under ideal consumption conditions for consumer equipment, since these were dimensioned based on voltage and power definitions in their projects. All this makes energy quality indicators extremely important concepts for consumers who use it. The definition of these quality indicators in the Brazilian energy system, are defined by the distribution procedures. It turns out that with the increase in distributed photovoltaic generations in recent years, an overvoltage phenomenon affects the distribution network due to the non-establishment of power limits of the plants installed in the consumer units, which in fact contribute a lot to the generation of these units, but which, at uncontrolled levels, cause the network voltage to violate the quality limits in the access of low voltage consumers. The main point of this work is the analysis of a circuit supplied by a real feeder, from a national utility, in which, through computer simulation, by the power flow simulation software OpenDSS (Open Distribution System Simulator), together with the Python programming language, it is possible to explore the insertion of distributed generators in the system, verifying the moments in which the voltage reaches the problematic values of the voltage limits. <a href="https://repositorio.ufu.br/handle/123456789/34549" target="_blank">READ MORE HERE</a>.
